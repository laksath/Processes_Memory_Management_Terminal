# Processes_Memory_Management_Terminal

We have addressed these issues with our own custom made command prompt which not only performs
the inbuilt commands but also looks after these issues raised with our own commands.

We first created the command prompt using the help of pipes and virtual files.

When a user enters a command we execute it in our code and store them by overriding the exec()
command.Inorder to denote that this is a custom made terminal running, we have given our default
colorings with a black background for the text.

The heading was aligned at center using the ioctl(STDOUT_FILENO, TIOCGWINSZ, &w); command
which returns the width of the command prompt.

Arrows that cause ^[[A] sometimes in terminal are also prevented.We have used getch() in our terminal to
input each and every character.The arrows are analyzed and are removed accordingly.
We address these problems into three major components :

1.pcinfo

2.findall

3.manager
